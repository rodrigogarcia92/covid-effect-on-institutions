Data Science Project: Covid Effects on Institutional Performance

This analysis was part of the design of a Program of the Ministerio de Educaci√≥n of Peru (Minedu). This is a brief and public version of that analysis.
The aim of the analysis was to investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic affected institutional performance, specifically in the education sector in Peru.

This project was developed in R.

Also, a Power Point presentation is a vailable for a brief overview of the project: [presentation/Covid effects on institutional performance.pdf](https://github.com/rodrigogarcia92/covid-effect-on-institutions/blob/0cf31b205f65753435760506b9454119c698fe14/presentation/Covid%20effects%20on%20institutional%20performance.pdf)

I couldn't upload the "Matricula_01.dbf" file, as it was bigger than 100MB. It can be downloaded in the Minedu ESCALE website: https://escale.minedu.gob.pe/uee/-/document_library_display/GMv7/view/6226837
